# Agile Object-Oriented Software Development 02160
You will find here the design of a simple program to play a simplified version of checker [1]. Specifically, the program prints the board and then alternatively ask the correct player to insert the old and the new coordinates of the piece to move. The system checks whether the coordinates refer indeed to a playerâ€™s owned piece and that the new position fulfills the requirements (i.e., diagonal forward move in an empty cell). The program continues until the user terminates it. The project uses object orientation, exception gandlings and unit tests.
